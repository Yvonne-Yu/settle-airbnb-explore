# Installation

The code should run with no issues on python 3.

# Project motivation
For this project, I was motivated to answer below 3 business questions:
- When do people book their stay at Seattle Airbnb?Â 
- What are the listings available on the market? What are the ones more expensive and what are the ones more popular?
- Can we predict the price of a listing based on the property features?

# File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here that address the questions above.
Datasets were downloaded from Kaggle project - https://www.kaggle.com/code/moh3azzam/seattle-airbnb-data/data
